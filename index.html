      <h1>Highlights On Environmental Study</h1>
      <h2>Why Environmental Awareness is important!</h2>
      <p>Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness around the natural environment and the
        choices that either promote its well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the earth is in
        need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are
        responsible to protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions. As previously stated,
        human-made choices are the number one reason why the planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a
        large scale is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences of these human decisions and help the
        planet’s health take a complete 180 degree in the other direction.</p>
      <h2>Major Environmental Problems</h2>
      <p>Some environmental life species require substantial areas to help provide food, living space, and other
        different assets. These creatures are called area specific. At the point when the biome is divided, the vast
        patches of living space don’t exist anymore. It becomes more troublesome for the wildlife to get the assets they
        need in order to survive. The environment goes on, even though the animals and plant life are not there to help
        sustain it properly.</p>

          <span>Land Disturbance</span>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-description">
          <p>A more basic cause of environmental degradation is land damage. Numerous weedy plant species, for example,
            garlic & mustard, are both foreign and obtrusive. A rupture in the environmental surroundings provides for
            them a chance to start growing and spreading. These plants can assume control over nature, eliminating the
            local greenery. The result is a territory with a solitary predominant plant which doesn’t give satisfactory
            food assets to all the environmental life. Thus the whole environment can be destroyed because of these
            invasive species.</p>

          <span>Pollution</span>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-description">
          <p>Pollution, in whatever form, whether it is air, water, land or noise is harmful to the environment. Air
            pollution pollutes the air that we breathe, which causes health issues. Water pollution degrades the quality
            of water that we use for drinking purposes. Land pollution results in the degradation of the earth’s surface
            as a result of human activities. Noise pollution can cause irreparable damage to our ears when exposed to
            continuous large sounds like honking of vehicles on a busy road or machines producing large noise in a
            factory or a mill.</p>

          <span>Over Population</span>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-description">
          <p>Rapid population growth puts strain on natural resources, which results in the degradation of our
            environment. Mortality rate has gone down due to better medical facilities, which has resulted in an
            increased lifespan. More population simply means more demand for food, clothes and shelter. You need more
            space to grow food and provide homes to millions of people. This results in deforestation, which is another
            factor in environmental degradation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="highlight-description">
          <p>Landfills pollute the environment and destroy the beauty of the city. Landfills come within the city due to
            the large amount of waste that gets generated by households, industries, factories and hospitals. Landfills
            pose a great risk to the health of the environment and the people who live there. Landfills produce a foul
            smell when burned and cause substantial environmental degradation.</p>

          <span>Deforestation</span>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-description">
          <p>Deforestation is the cutting down of trees to make way for more homes and industries. Rapid growth in
            population and urban sprawl are two of the major causes of deforestation. Apart from that, the use of forest
            land for agriculture, animal grazing, harvest for fuelwood and logging are some of the other causes of
            deforestation. Deforestation contributes to global warming as decreased forest size puts carbon back into
            the environment.</p>
